# Global Gas Production Analysis

## Overview
This project provides an interactive visualization and detailed insights into global gas production from 1992 to 2022. The data highlights the cumulative gas production of countries across multiple continents, with a particular focus on trends and shifts in production during this period. The analysis includes a visual representation of the gas production by country, as well as a breakdown by region and overall global contributions.

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to analyze and present global gas production data in an intuitive manner, enabling users to explore and understand the following key aspects:
- The cumulative gas production of each country over the 30-year period.
- The share of each country's contribution to global gas production.
- Regional trends in gas production.

## Data Source
- The dataset used in this project contains global gas production data for the years 1992 to 2022.
- It includes data for major gas-producing countries and regions, visualized in the Tableau dashboard.

## Key Insights
- **Top Producers**: The United States, Russia, and Canada are among the top gas producers, contributing significantly to global gas production.
- **Regional Overview**: North America, Europe, and Asia account for the largest shares of global gas production.
- **Country-Level Data**: Each country is represented in the visualization with its respective contribution to global gas production in exajoules.

## Features
- Interactive map and charts displaying the gas production for each country.
- A detailed breakdown of gas production by region, allowing users to explore trends over time.
- Color-coded visualizations to easily identify top gas-producing countries and regions.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.

## How to Use
1. Open the provided Tableau Workbook file (`Global-Gas-Production.twbx`).
2. Use the interactive map to explore gas production across different countries.
3. Hover over regions or countries to view detailed data on gas production in exajoules.
4. Click on regions or countries for a more in-depth view of their gas production trends over the years.

## Data Description
- **Cumulative Gas Production**: Measured in Exajoules (EJ).
- **Regions**: The data is broken down into regions such as North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania.
- **Gas Production Values**: The dataset includes values from 1992 to 2022, with each country's total gas production over this time period.

## Conclusion
This Tableau project offers a comprehensive view of global gas production trends from 1992 to 2022, enabling users to gain a deeper understanding of the global energy landscape.
